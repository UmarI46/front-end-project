Here's the live version of the website: https://front-end-project-mauve.vercel.app/
(Just give it some time to fetch the data from the backend)

Quick run down: You are signed into the website as "jessjelly"  and are able to look at different articles on the site. You can sort by a few different options on the home page. 
Going to topics allows you to filter by a specific topic. 
Clicking on a specific article allows you to go to another page for it and then vote on it, add a comment to it and delete your own comment from it.
